## 🎯 Overview

Welcome to the **Duel Commander Metagame Dashboard** — a small community-driven project.

This project started from a small local experiment in Rennes,
France. The question was simple: *could we prepare for tournaments
seriously?* People started thinking about logging their games in
some sort of data sheets. That's when I decided to come up with this
*project*.

It started with a few games here and there registered by friends. A
week after, I was recording every local FNM games results with some
sort of automation. A month later, I plugged in the first 100 player
tournament data.

We think that this silly project deserve a bit more results than our
small local community now, and that everyone should have access to those
informations.

## The project

As a user, you simply record your game result through **[this
form](https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycbypLu4K7h7oZ7k6kKpNl0uWtzl0QRcZQJB4Axfd--1vffgGcsnXSPUsHlWCpCusXva9/exec)**
(which is nothing more than a pimped google form, cf section "How does
it work" if you are interested). The most important data there are the
results and the command zone. You **must** enter them to make an
entry. Other fields are optionnal, but can help retrieve your data if
you happens to make mistakes. Feel free to provide them or not.

From those entry, graphics like the ones in Metagame Overview are produced.

## 🏆 For Tournament Organizers

If you organize Duel Commander events, you can definitively help enrich the dataset!

Typically, you will have a form of dataset matching each player name
with a command zone and sone access to a running eventlink. If that's
the case, you can contact me directly on discord @mwapl and I will
show you how to produce data entries.

No dark magic here, only a light chrome extension to extract game
results from eventlink, and a python script to match player names
between pairings and your decklist entry.

> 🧰 Coming soon: an online version of those explainations with all the formating tools needed.

title: "French Duel Commander Metagame Project"

## 🎯 Overview

Welcome to the **Duel Commander Metagame Dashboard** — a small community-driven project.

This project started from a small local experiment in Rennes,
France. The question was simple: *could we prepare for tournaments
seriously?* People started thinking about logging their games in
some sort of data sheets. That's when I decided to come up with this
*project*.

It started with a few games here and there registered by friends. A
week after, I was recording every local FNM games results with some
sort of automation. A month later, I plugged in the first 100 player
tournament data.

We think that this silly project deserve a bit more results than our
small local community now, and that everyone should have access to those
informations.

## 💾 The Project

Players can easily record their games using this **[submission form](https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycbypLu4K7h7oZ7k6kKpNl0uWtzl0QRcZQJB4Axfd--1vffgGcsnXSPUsHlWCpCusXva9/exec)**.

The form is essentially a stylized Google Form (see *How It Works* below for details).  
The most important fields are:
  - **Match result**  
  - **Command zones** (both your and your opponent’s)

Other fields are optional but can help us fix errors or provide richer context.

From these entries, the system automatically computes metagame metrics and produces visuals like those below.

## 📊 Metagame Overview

The plots below summarize data collected since the most recent Duel Commander banlist.  
They highlight the **top 20 command zones** by number of recorded games.

Try out the **[interactive Shiny app](https://your-shinyapps-url.shinyapps.io/metagame/)** — look at even more plots, compare time periods, or dive into specific matchups.

## 🏆 For Tournament Organizers

If you organize Duel Commander events, you can definitively help enrich the dataset!

Typically, you will have a form of dataset matching each player name
with a command zone and sone access to a running eventlink. If that's
the case, you can contact me directly on discord @mwapl and I will
show you how to produce data entries.

No dark magic here, only a light chrome extension to extract game
results from eventlink, and a python script to match player names
between pairings and your decklist entry.

> 🧰 Coming soon: an online version of those explainations with all the formating tools needed.

## 🔍 How It Works

Here’s a simplified overview of the process:

1. **Game data collection**

   Players record their match results through a public form.
   This form is actually a custom Google Apps Script that mimics a standard Google Form but adds smarter behavior:
   - Auto-completion for CZ
   - Automatic detection of partners and backgrounds
   - Dynamic synchronization of legal commanders retrieved directly from Scryfall

2. **Automated data retrieval**

   A scheduled GitHub Action runs a Python script to download the form responses from the linked google sheet.

3. **Data processing & visualization**

   **R** scripts preprocess the data and generate static interactive plots with **ggplot2** and **plotly**. A dynamic page
   allowing to select the number of command zones and the time period is also contructed through **shiny app**.

4. **Static website build**

   The plots are embedded here on this site, automatically updated every evening with **Quarto**.

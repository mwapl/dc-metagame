The question was simple: could we prepare for tournaments more seriously? People started thinking about logging their games in some sort of data sheets. That‚Äôs when I decided to come up with this project.\nIt started with a few games here and there registered by friends. A week after, I was recording every local FNM games results with some sort of automation. A month later, I plugged in the first 100 player tournament data.\nWe think that this silly project deserve a bit more results than our small local community now, and that everyone should have access to those informations."

It should be read as: ‚ÄúRow has X% win rate against Column.‚Äù\n\nThe diagonal is fixed at 50% for easier visual comparison.\nHovering over a cell displays the exact number of games contributing to that matchup.\n\nThis gives a quick overview of which decks tend to overperform or struggle in specific pairings.\n\n\nWinrate confidence intervals\n\n\n\n\nThis chart shows each deck‚Äôs average win rate along with its 95% confidence interval - that is, the range within which the true win rate is expected to fall 95% of the time given current data.\nA few important notes: - Confidence intervals become less reliable when the number of recorded games is low. - Average win rates are meta-dependent - they reflect performance against the decks actually played in this dataset. If your local metagame differs significantly, results may vary.\n\n\nMetagame Share\n\n\n\n\nThis plot ranks decks by their share of recorded games in the dataset. The percentage represents how often each command zone appeared, and hovering over a bar reveals the exact number of games played.\nWant to explore further?\nTry out the interactive Shiny app ‚Äî look at even more plots, compare time periods, or dive into specific matchups.\n\n‚ö†Ô∏è Note: The app is hosted for free on shinyapps.io,\nso it may occasionally be unavailable due to hosting limits."

If that‚Äôs the case, you can contact me directly on discord @mwapl and I will show you how to produce data entries.\nNo dark magic here, only a light chrome extension to extract game results from eventlink, and a python script to match player names between pairings and your decklist entry.\n\nüß∞ Coming soon: an online version of those explainations with all the formating tools needed."

This form is actually a custom Google Apps Script that mimics a standard Google Form but adds smarter behavior:\n\nAuto-completion for CZ\nAutomatic detection of partners and backgrounds\nDynamic synchronization of legal commanders retrieved directly from Scryfall\n\nAutomated data retrieval\nA scheduled GitHub Action runs a Python script to download the form responses from the linked google sheet.\nData processing & visualization\nR scripts preprocess the data and generate static interactive plots with ggplot2 and plotly. A dynamic page allowing to select the number of command zones and the time period is also contructed through shiny app.\nStatic website build\nThe plots are embedded here on this site, automatically updated every evening with Quarto."

The question was simple: could we prepare for tournaments seriously? People started thinking about logging their games in some sort of data sheets. That‚Äôs when I decided to come up with this project.\nIt started with a few games here and there registered by friends. A week after, I was recording every local FNM games results with some sort of automation. A month later, I plugged in the first 100 player tournament data.\nWe think that this silly project deserve a bit more results than our small local community now, and that everyone should have access to those informations."

The most important data there are the results and the command zone. You must enter them to make an entry. Other fields are optionnal, but can help retrieve your data if you happens to make mistakes. Feel free to provide them or not.\nFrom those entry, graphics like the ones in Metagame Overview are produced."

    "text": "üèÜ For Tournament Organizers\nIf you organize Duel Commander events, you can definitively help enrich the dataset!\nTypically, you will have a form of dataset matching each player name with a command zone and sone access to a running eventlink. If that‚Äôs the case, you can contact me directly on discord @mwapl and I will show you how to produce data entries.\nNo dark magic here, only a light chrome extension to extract game results from eventlink, and a python script to match player names between pairings and your decklist entry.\n\nüß∞ Coming soon: an online version of those explainations with all the formating tools needed."

# What is this?

Little github repo using github action to automatically update some metagame informations for french Duel Commander.

Fill in form to register your game results can be found [here](https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycbypLu4K7h7oZ7k6kKpNl0uWtzl0QRcZQJB4Axfd--1vffgGcsnXSPUsHlWCpCusXva9/exec).

The github action produces the following [shiny app web application](https://5uwf89-mathieu-laurent.shinyapps.io/MetagameCDF2025/) in which you can play with the data from the
last games that were recorded by players.
